# Best Practices for Laravel Development

Here are some recommended best practices for Laravel development:

1. **Don't write business logic in blade files:** Blade files should only contain necessary HTML, CSS, and JS code for rendering views, and business logic should be written in controllers or other dedicated classes.

2. **Use env() function only in config files:** Values in the `.env` file should be confidential and not accessed directly in application code, so `env()` function should only be used in config files.

3. **Avoid using callbacks in routes:** Callbacks in routes should be avoided as they can make code difficult to maintain. Instead, use controllers or dedicated classes.

4. **Use unique route names:** Each route should have a unique name to avoid naming conflicts and improve code readability.

5. **Use Spatie Media Library for file uploads:** This package provides a simple API to manage file uploads and media files, and offers features such as image manipulation and file validation.

6. **Delete associated images from the server:** When deleting records associated with images, delete the images from the server to avoid unnecessary storage usage.

7. **Avoid using Eloquent queries in loops:** Use Eloquent queries instead of looping over results to improve performance and reduce the number of database queries.

8. **Keep blade files simple and avoid writing direct PHP:** Blade files should remain simple, and any business logic should be written in controllers or other dedicated classes.

9. **Use PHP enums instead of external packages for status/types:** Using enums in PHP can help keep code lightweight and avoid dependencies on external packages.

10. **Use Laravel's queue system for time-consuming tasks:** Use the queue system to run time-consuming tasks in the background and improve performance.

11. **Use meaningful variable and function names:** Descriptive names for variables and functions make code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

12. **Strive for simplicity and readability:** Simple, readable code is easier to understand and maintain.

13. **Use comments to explain complex code:** Comments help other developers understand the code, document APIs, or provide context for the code.

14. **Implement proper error handling:** Proper error handling can help the application recover from unexpected errors and prevent crashes. Use try-catch blocks and error messages to provide feedback to users.

15. **Use eager loading to reduce database queries:** Eager loading allows loading all related data with a single query, improving performance by reducing the number of database queries.
